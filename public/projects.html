					<h3>This Website: 2013</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Runs on Node.js, which I wrote the server code myself in a previous project, so I reused that.</li>
						<li>Having been mostly a backend developer until the last few months, I had some fun digging into CSS and learning some new styling tricks (like the hover effect on the navigation options above).</li>
						<li>Familiarizing myself with Heroku and Git (again).</li>
						<li>Groaning over how terrible my calendar JavaScript code was from years ago. Although I refactored it a bit, it still could use a lot more TLC.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Feel free to take a look at the code on <a href="https://github.com/tarish/website">github</a>.</p>

					<h3>Honing JavaScript via Exercism: JavaScript Exercises 2013</h3>
					<p>As a tool to learn how to better code in JavaScript (JS), I joined Exercism.io and started practicing writing JS while solving simple string 
						manipulation exercises. Not only did I make all the provided tests pass, but then I submitted my solutions to the community and refactored 
						those solutions until the community was pleased with their readability and simplicity.</p>
					<p>While waiting on feedback from the community regarding my code, I also spent time critiquing JS solutions submitted by others. In some ways, 
						critiquing others' code felt more valuable, as it often led to researching best practices in JS before I'd give feedback.</p>
					<p>EXAMPLES COMING SOON!</p>

					<h3>JavaScript Generated Calendar: 2010 (Refactored 2013)</h3>
					<p>The calendar you see below is automatically generated by JavaScript. Fresh out of school and curious about JavaScript, I found some broken code on the web
						where the author stated "if you can fix this, you can have it." I fixed it and then added a bit to it:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Fixed the layout itself so that the correct date would be displayed under the correct day of the week.</li>
						<li>Added code to make sure that every month of the year displayed correctly--including leap years.</li>
						<li>Added code to show today's date in bold-face.</li>
						<li>As noted above, when I resurrected this code while starting this website, I refactored it to be more readable, but it still could use some work.</li>
					</ul>
