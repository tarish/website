					<h3>This Website: 2013</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Runs on Node.js, which I wrote the server code myself in a previous project, so I reused that.</li>
						<li>Having been mostly a backend developer until the last few months, I had some fun digging into CSS and learning some new styling tricks (like the hover effect on the navigation options above).</li>
						<li>Familiarizing myself with Heroku and Git (again).</li>
						<li>Groaning over how terrible my calendar JavaScript code was from years ago. Although I refactored it a bit, it still could use a lot more TLC.</li>
						<li>Added a snippet of jQueryUI around my social network icons on the Interests page just for fun. Likely will change before all is said and done.</li>
					</ul>

					<h3>Honing JavaScript via Exercism: JavaScript Exercises 2013</h3>
					<p>As a tool to learn how to better code in JavaScript, I joined <a href="http://exercism.io/">Exercism.io</a> and started practicing writing JavaScript
					 while solving simple string manipulation exercises. Not only did I implement a solution, but then I submitted my solutions to the community to be critiqued
					 and then refactored those solutions until the community was pleased with their readability and simplicity.</p>
					<p>While waiting on feedback from the community regarding my code, I also spent time critiquing others' solutions for puzzles I'd already finished. At times, 
						critiquing others' code felt more valuable, as it often led to me researching JavaScript best practices before I'd give feedback.</p>
					<p>Feel free to check out my exercises in their final form on <a href="https://github.com/tarish/exercises/tree/master/javascript">github</a>. Take note: the Fizz-Buzz and Palindrome code/tests are my own exercises I did just for fun and are not from exercism.</p>

					<h3>JavaScript Generated Calendar: 2010 (Refactored 2013)</h3>
					<p>The calendar you see below is automatically generated by JavaScript. Fresh out of school and curious about JavaScript, I found some broken code on the web
						where the author stated "if you can fix this, you can have it." I fixed it and then added a bit to it:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Fixed the layout itself so that the correct date would be displayed under the correct day of the week.</li>
						<li>Added code to make sure that every month of the year displayed correctly--including leap years.</li>
						<li>Added code to show today's date in bold-face.</li>
						<li>As noted above, when I resurrected this code for this website, I refactored it to be more readable, but it still could use some work.</li>
					</ul>

					<h3>CATspace: Using Facebook to Share Assignments Among Professors (Spring 2008)</h3>
					<p>Contributors: Tarish Smith, Idris Eltahir, Ricardo Quintana-Castillo<br/>
					Faculty Advisors: Dr. Manuel A. Perez-Quinones, Dr. Stephen Edwards</p>
					<p>ABSTRACT: The CATspace research project involved designing and prototyping a new social networking application. We chose to use Facebook, because its social network is already established around academia, and its application API allows external applications to be integrated with Facebook. The CATspace application allows computer science educators to post, exchange, rate, and reuse complete course assignments (assignment write-ups, grading rubrics, solutions, etc.). Our team met weekly to collaborate on the design and iteratively refine the prototype. We implemented that data model using Ruby on Rails. Additionally, we used FBML, CSS, and AJAX to implement the user interface. Navigation uses tagging, tabs, sorting options, and a CATspace news feed and profile notifications providing links to the affected assignment. Both a partial and an expanded view of each assignment is available, along with an option to download the assignment or install it on the sister program - Web-CAT. The next stage will include implementing the ability to instantly edit uploaded assignments, add additional search options, develop the community features, and launch the application.</p>
					<p>RESULT: Won First Place "People's Choice Award" at the <a href="https://secure.hosting.vt.edu/www.vturcs.cs.vt.edu/spring08.php">VTURCS Spring Symposium 2008</a></p>
